  title: Learning Intra-Batch Connections for Deep Metric Learning
  abstract: The goal of metric learning is to learn a function that maps samples to a lower-dimensional space where similar samples lie closer than dissimilar ones. Particularly, deep metric learning utilizes neural networks to learn such a mapping. Most approaches rely on losses that only take the relations between pairs or triplets of samples into account, which either belong to the same class or two different classes. However, these methods do not explore the embedding space in its entirety. To this end, we propose an approach based on message passing networks that takes all the relations in a mini-batch into account. We refine embedding vectors by exchanging messages among all samples in a given batch allowing the training process to be aware of its overall structure. Since not all samples are equally important to predict a decision boundary, we use an attention mechanism during message passing to allow samples to weigh the importance of each neighbor accordingly. We achieve state-of-the-art results on clustering and image retrieval on the CUB-200-2011, Cars196, Stanford Online Products, and In-Shop Clothes datasets.

  title: Improving Instance Classification by Representation Learning
  abstract: We have witnessed the growing significance of representation learning in computer vision. In this talk, we will present our studies of exploiting various methods of representation learning, including supervised/semi-supervised/unsupervised representation learning and representation learning by leveraging side information, in the context of large-scale image search and classification, long-tailed image classification, and ReID. On one hand, our large-scale studies show that it is important for methods to exploit all the possible hints to effectively guide the construction of appropriate representations for images. On the other hand, it is also crucial to carefully explore the supervised information for representation learning, as they can be noisy, inaccurate, or incomplete in terms of describing rich visual content.
